## Unit 20 - Tableau | Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

## Task

** In this assignment, the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs is used to build a data dashboard, story, or report.**
** Jersey City Bike Trip Data from April 2017 to March 2018 (last one year) has been used for the analysis.**
** Answers to the following questions are provided in Tableau Work Book.**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months (for whatever year of data you selected)? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months (for whatever year of data you selected)?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, the following visualizations are included:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.
